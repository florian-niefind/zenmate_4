# zenmate_4: Task 4 from the Zenmate Coding Challenge

You can simply run the 'run_me.py' from a shell via 'python run_me.py' once you have cloned the repo to your machine. 

Another option is to inspect the ipython notebook on github instead of running the program yourself. It gives a few more printouts as well as minimal comments of my thought process in markdown.

Next steps:
- time slots are objects so that the MeetingRoom class does not contain three lists, but rather one list of time slots
- events are objects too
- test suite
- PEP-8 conformity
